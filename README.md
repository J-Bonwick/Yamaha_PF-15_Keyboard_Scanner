# Yamaha_PF-15_Keyboard_Scanner
Retrofit a yamaha PF-15 keyboard with an arduino to output midi.

If you ever happen upon an old Yamaha PF-15 and it doesn't have an affinity for actually working, this code is for you!
Designed for keyboards that can't output their own sound, it takes input from the keyboard and outputs MIDI, where it could be sent to a pc for further processing and use.
